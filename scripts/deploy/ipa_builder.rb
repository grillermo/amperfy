# frozen_string_literal: true

# ipa_builder.rb
#
# Builds an ad-hoc-signed Amperfy .ipa from source, together with the OTA
# manifest.plist that an `itms-services://` link points at. Used by ../../deploy.
#
# The .ipa is signed with the paid Apple Developer Program team in
# Config/Local.xcconfig (DEVELOPMENT_TEAM). That is what lets iOS install it
# straight from Safari over an `itms-services://` link -- no AltStore, no cable,
# and a signature good for a year instead of the free tier's 7 days. The price is
# that an Ad Hoc profile only covers **devices registered on the portal**: a
# device whose UDID was added after this .ipa was built cannot install it, so
# adding a device means registering it and then re-running ../../deploy.
#
# Set AMPERFY_UNSIGNED=1 to fall back to an unsigned archive. That build cannot
# be installed from Safari; it exists so a broken signing setup does not block
# producing a binary.
#
# Fork specifics: signed as me.chiq.amperfy (with the Siri capability) for team
# Q3WS4MWCW3. CarPlay audio is an entitlement Apple grants per team and this one
# does not have it, so Amperfy/Amperfy.entitlements drops it in this fork.
#
# Nothing stays on this Mac. Every artifact (DerivedData, resolved packages,
# the archive, the export's logs in TMPDIR, the .ipa) lives in one work dir
# under build/ that ../../deploy deletes on exit, success or failure, along with
# any provisioning profile Xcode downloaded for the export. The SwiftFormat build
# phase is skipped (AMPERFY_SKIP_SWIFTFORMAT): its `swift run` fills SwiftPM's
# caches in ~/Library, outside anything we could clean.
